# Invoke-Win10Upgrade
Powershell module for remote in-place upgrades of Windows 7/8 to Windows 10.

# Overview
This module uses PowerShell and Microsoft Deployment Toolkit in order to remotely perform in-place upgrades of domain-joined Windows machines to Windows 10. The main use case for this module is for organizations that do not use SCCM but want to the ability to remotely perform mass in-place upgrades. This module is a work around for the requirement of in-place upgrades with MDT that require interactive logons and to launch the litetouch.vbs script. To get around this requirement we use PowerShell and a Remote Desktop session to each computer, then launch litetouch.vbs with a scheduled task. This is admittedly a complete hack and I offer no guarantee to any user of this script. With that said, I plan on using this.

# Prerequisites
- Computers must be joined to Active Directory.
- PowerShell remoting is enabled on workstations.
- PowerShell v4+ is used on the server running the Invoke-Win10Upgrade command.
- Module should be used with at least Local Admin privledges on workstations and permission to the MDT share.
